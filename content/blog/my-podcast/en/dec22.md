This was supposed to be the easiest episode of all and has been the hardest. I guess it has something to do with how hard it is to be playful in lifeâ€¦ sometimes.

When I was almost ready to record Episode 5 I got sick and my voice was raspy and made me feel uncomfortable.

Now that I am healthy again, I am committed to recording it before 2022 ends.
