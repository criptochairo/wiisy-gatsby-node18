On April 19, 2022 I published **Episode #2: Words That Promise**.

In this episode, I tell you how and when I met my Carlos, how our relationship evolved, and finally, how we got to our two weddings, the civil and the one we created and held at a restaurant called *Rosa Mexicano* in New York City.

I talk about all these details to give you some context before you hear me reading the marriage vows I wrote to my now-husband.
