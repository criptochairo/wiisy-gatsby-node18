For this month my recommendation is that you watch the documentary:

***“Los 14 ochomiles. No hay nada imposible”***.

That's the title in Spanish, and it's on Netflix.

In the United States it is:

**"14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible"**.

It's a very inspiring story.

And if you want to know more about **Project Possible**, visit the website of the documentary's high altitude expedition leader, Nimsdai Purja:
