**Dear Sister, this month's question is:**

— **What characteristics do you think someone who leads a team of people at work should have?**

— *Well, I think it depends on the type of work and how many people there are in your team because the bigger the team you oversee, the more difficult it is to get to know each one of the members in-depth.*

*But assuming that it is a manageable number, I think it would be good for the person who leads to be empathic with the team members and to find a way to get to know them better to guide the strengths of each one towards the achievement of the team's objectives.*

*I think it is desirable that this person be responsible and organized since I have seen cases of people with a lot of knowledge but who cannot get their team to meet the deadlines.*

*And I think that it is also desirable that the person be intelligent because it is very demotivating to have a boss who has no idea of the issues that are the responsibility of the team.*

*That's what I think, but it's ok to have a different opinion!*
