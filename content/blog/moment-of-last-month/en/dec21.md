As the photos show, Maya and I finally and officially explored our respective musical instruments! What does this mean? Well, she picked up my guitar and I picked up her violin and we both played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" (Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125) separately with the other's help.

I served as her first guitar teacher and she was my first violin teacher. What a moment! Maya was amazing, playing not only this piece but others with such fluidity. And she told me I was a quick learner too with the violin. So, for our first moment of the month, we share our musicality!
