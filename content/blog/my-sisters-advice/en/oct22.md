This month I asked my sister how to attain peace of mind.

Well, it turns out that she is one of the hardest working and responsible people I know and right now she is very focused on a project at work that requires her full attention.

So, instead of pressuring her to answer my question, I decided that I was going to give her space to rest, at least from my project, and thus give her peace of mind.

See you here until next month ðŸ˜Š.
