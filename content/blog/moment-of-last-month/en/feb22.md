This month Maya and I celebrated our birthdays in style!

We ordered two separate delicious carrot cakes with unique surprise decorations from Vasantha, a local Ithaca, NY cake-making master!

Maya and I selected our respective birthday celebrations as the *Moment of the Month* for two related reasons:

1) we love carrot cake, and 2) carrot cake was my mother (Mami), Virginia Morales's favorite cake too (Maya's paternal grandma), with whom I shared the same birthday (Feb. 1) and who passed at the young age of 66 in early May 2015.

We miss her very much!

So, in honor of my Mami, Maya and I will make carrot cake, our traditional birthday cake, from here on out!

Enjoy our photos too!
