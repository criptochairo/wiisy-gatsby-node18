Hi, mom.

**What do you recommend for this first month of the year?**

*Hello dear,*

*We just went to a restaurant in Mexico City, in the colonia Roma, on Zacatecas Street. Your brother Luis recommended it to us. It's called “[Lalo!](https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Lalo!/@19.4153858,-99.1646584,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x85d1ff395f34802d:0x1c6328f5be71ded7!8m2!3d19.4153858!4d-99.1624697)”.*

*The food is delicious, and the service is excellent.*

*I ordered a dessert they call French Bread but it has nothing to do with what it's commonly known by that name. It was delicious!*
