**Dear sister, how do you think a family can best decide where to live, taking into account all family members?**

â€” *Your questions are very complex ha-ha, but here's what I think:*

*I think there is no one size fits all solution. I suppose that if there is no other element to take into account, what decides where the family settles is where the source of income is; which will probably depend on the parents. But, for example, if a family member has a health problem, it is possible that the family's place of residence could be changed, even though this could have an impact on the family income.*

*I would like to think that parents make these decisions based on what they consider to be the best for the family; and even if they listen to everyone's opinion, not everyone will necessarily be happy with the decision.*

*But such is life. You can't always leave everyone happy, ha-ha.*
