As I sat down to write Episode 4, on Words that are Cathartic, I realized that there were a lot of things I needed to find out about the life of my maternal grandmother, Mami.

I think I'm going to do the same thing I did with the previous episode: I'm going to take my time so that what I end up posting reflects, in the most honest way, who my beloved grandmother was.
