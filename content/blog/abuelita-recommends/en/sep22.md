**What do you recommend this month?**

*This part of a letter that Einstein wrote to Freud in an epistolary exchange that they held.*

>“I am convinced that almost all great men who, because of their accomplishments, are recognized as leaders even of small groups share the same ideals. But they have little influence on the course of political events. It would almost appear that the very domain of human activity most crucial to the fate of nations is inescapably in the hands of wholly irresponsible political rulers.”

**And now tell me why you recommend reading this quote?**

*Because it seems to me an interesting opinion issued by a person considered very intelligent.*

*I often feel that the future of humanity is in the hands of politicians who are currently controlled by big corporations. And I see that they are more interested in the economic contributions they receive for their campaigns than even the health of the planet.*

*I consider this not only irresponsible but practically blind and it reminds me of an illustration that my husband used in his courses at IBM:*

*There are four people in a boat that has a hole in one end and is sinking. Two of them are working to remove the water that is entering the boat, and the other two, without doing anything, just say "how great that the hole is on your side".*
