Gina (I call her Georgina) is one of my first cousins, the second daughter of my dad's brother.

Since she was a little girl, we could see that she had a very special spark, like she wanted to eat the world. And now she, older, married and with daughters, is taking over the world one day at a time.

It is impressive to see how she has been solving all the obstacles that life has put in front of her. I admire who she has become and everything she has achieved through hard work and dedication.

Here are 10 questions I asked her, so you can get to know her better:

***1. How would you describe yourself?***

I am a fun, committed person who sets goals.

Somehow, I have a certain discipline.

***2. What do you want from life?***

Overall: Happiness and quality of life.

But I also set myself short-term and medium-term goals about what I want, so I always do something to achieve them.
  
***3. Why do you do the things you do?***

In general, I do things out of passion and that encourages me to keep doing them.
  
***4. How do you understand the process of "what if I say yes?"***

How to give yourself the opportunity to get out of everyday life and/or to live life as socially they told you it had to be.
  
***5. What would you say was your first "what if I say yes" moment?***

My daughter Tania had already been born (I was 19 years old), and there was a social expectation that I would have to work to take care of my daughter's expenses; however, the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM) had started its enrollment season and I wanted to continue studying.

So, I used some money, which my godmother Rocío gave me for my birthday, to pay for the entrance exam; that is: what if I say yes to my dream and give up the social expectation?

And so, I followed the dream.

I still remember that there was some backlash to my decision, but my parents supported me and let me move on when I was accepted to college.

***6. Describe your most recent "what if I say yes?" moment.***

Well, recently, a friend told me that she was going to travel to Portugal, and I told her half-jokingly: “Hey, invite me” and she invited me!

So, I thought, well, now I'm going to tell Niger (my husband), I don’t have anything to lose. I told him and he said: “You should go” … And, well, I am answering your questions from Portugal!

***7. What things have you created in your life after saying "what if I say yes?" Make a list.***

Well, it has more to do with academic and professional achievements:

1) I have a college degree in Sociology from UAM (Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana)

2) I have a master's degree in Gender Studies from COLMEX (Colegio de México)

3) I have a doctorate in Social Anthropology from the ENAH (Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia)

4) I did a postdoc at UNAM’s CIEG (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios de Género)

5) I belong to the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores

6) I don't know if I have created (because it sounds very definitive), but I seek a life with certain stability that is consistent with my political and social position.

***8. How have others reacted to your “what if I say yes?” process?***

Well, in some cases they have judged my decisions; and in others, I see that there is a certain admiration.
  
***9. What will be your next “what if I say yes” moment?***

I recently had a “what if I say yes?” moment. I got a happy outcome, for which I will have to make a change in my life.
  
***10. What have you learned from the "what if I say yes" process?***

That it is worth giving yourself opportunities in this life journey (because we do not know if it will be short or long) in such a way that it is worth imprinting love and passion.
