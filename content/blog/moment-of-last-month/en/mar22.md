***Maya***: This month, I had fun practicing baseball. I felt stronger than I did several years ago. I can now throw the ball farther. Papa and I worked on some fielding, throwing, and hitting on the field. I am so excited to play baseball on a team for the first time in April!

***Carlos***: This month, I helped Maya get ready for her first Little league season. We purchased new baseball pants, a belt, a baseball bat, and new cleats at Instant Replay Sports here in Ithaca. We worked on basic running drills, fielding, hitting, and throwing. She showed improvement in her fielding, running, and throwing. Hitting requires more practice and repetition, which will come with time. We went to Cass Park, where many league games will be played despite the drizzling rain and cold winds. Maya will be playing in the Cal Ripken Little league in April and is very excited! I am proud of her and look forward to watching her grow as a baseball player this summer.
