**How to decide where to spend Christmas or New Yearâ€™s Eve, when all family members want different things?**

I would suggest negotiating. Family union seems important to me, so I would try to negotiate to please everyone, but being at the same time managing to be all together (please some family members on one date, and others on the other date).

However, I know that this is not always possible and in the end, it is about everyone being happy. So, if it is not possible for everyone to be together, I would let everyone do whatever makes them happy... In the end, it's only two days of the year.

Of course, this depends on the age of the kids, because while they are young, they will have to adjust to the decisions of their parents.

I'm sorry, but there are no recipes to solve all the problems that result from family dynamics, ha-ha.
