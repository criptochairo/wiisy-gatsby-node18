Bankky is one of my dearest friends, here in Ithaca, NY.

I met her a few years ago and she quickly amazed me with her positive attitude towards life and tremendous creativity.

Here are 10 questions so you can get to know her:

***1. How would you describe yourself?***

***2. What do you want out of life?***

I want to learn about myself. I want to discover what I can do and what I like, find out what makes me happy, as well as try new things. I want to enjoy the life I have created with my family and to see my kids grow, choose their own paths and to support them. I want to help people by sharing what I know. I hope that it can inspire them.

***3. Why do you do the things you do?***

It makes me happy and I believe that life is supposed to feel good.

***4. How do you understand the “What If I Say Yes” process***?

My “What If I Say Yes” process is to first make the decision of whatever I want to do. Then, I just go and do it. The last and most important step is to ignore the naysayers.

***5. What would you say was your earliest “What If I Say Yes” moment?***

My earliest “What If I Say Yes” moment was when I decided to have a child at the age of 18 against my parents will. This was the first time I made an important decision for myself, by myself.

My most recent “What If I Say Yes Moment” was deciding that I wanted to learn how to play a ukulele. It's been six months since then, and I have made a lot of progress. Along the way, I have also found that playing ukulele is one of the many things that makes me happy.

***7. What things have you created in your life after having said “What If I Say Yes”? Make a list.***

A family, countless sewing projects, crochet, knitting, cardboard furniture and toys, woodworking, play felt food, a youtube channel, making printable patterns, the photoshop skill, 3D designing, learning how to cook, and the latest project crochet a chunky cardigan for my daughter.

***8. How have others reacted to your “What If I Say Yes” process?***

I don't really pay attention to what people think about what I do.

***9. What will be your next “What If I Say Yes” moment?***

For now, I don't know, but when the time does come, I'll know exactly what to do.

***10. What have you learned from the “What If I Say Yes” process?***
